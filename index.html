        <h3>Weather Application</h3>
        <p>
          The Weather Aplication is a Vanilla JavaScript project created as a
          part of the <i>SheCodes Plus</i> course. It is a responsive app that
          allows users to check the weather at a location of choice or at their
          current location. It also displays forecast for the closest future.
          Please check out the functionality of the app

        <p>
          This project is a React rewrite of the previous one, created as a
          final project for the <i>SheCodes React</i> course. It has the same
          functionality, but is built entirely on React's functional components.
          It was a serious introduction to React and helped me understand how
          this library works. Please check out the functionality of the app

          As I wanted to learn more about website design I took a SuperHi course
          <i>JavaScript for Designers</i>. I got to learn how to add layers to
          projects and make them more interesting and interactive. Why don't you

        <h3>Website design with React</h3>
        <p>
          To get to know React better I decided to follow SuperHi course
          <i>React.js</i>. Working on real life projects, using components and
          all the features and tricks that React has to offer, definitely helped
          me understand the potential of this library. Please take a moment to
