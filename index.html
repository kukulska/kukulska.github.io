        <h3>Weather Application</h3>
        <p>
          The Weather Aplication is a Vanilla JavaScript project created as a
          part of the <i>SheCodes Plus</i> course. It is a responsive app that
          allows users to check the weather at a location of choice or at their
          current location. It also displays forecast for the closest future.
          Please check out the functionality of the app

        <h3>Weather Application React</h3>
        <p>
          This project is a React rewrite of the previous one, created as a
          final project for the <i>SheCodes React</i> course. It has the same
          functionality, but is built entirely on React's functional components.
          It was a serious introduction to React and helped me understand how
          this library works. Please check out the functionality of the app

          As I wanted to learn more about website design I took a SuperHi course
          <i>JavaScript for Designers</i>. I got to learn how to add layers to
          projects and make them more interesting and interactive. Why don't you
          check out some of the features! Scroll down and enjoy the parallax

        <h3>Website design with React</h3>
        <p>
          To get to know React better I decided to follow SuperHi course
          <i>React.js</i>. Working on real life projects, using components and
          all the features and tricks that React has to offer, definitely helped
          me understand the potential of this library. To keep the focus on
          React and JS, not the CSS, Tachyons was introduced as a rapid styling
          utility, which is a great addition to web designer's toolkit. Please
          take a moment to discover Tokyo's attractions
